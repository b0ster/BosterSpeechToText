Original text;This story is about a kid everyone thought was so terrific and so cool. That kid was me. I knew how to draw great pictures. I even brushed my teeth, most of the time. And I had a few friends to play with. My parents left me alone a lot. They thought I was a cool kid. But that was only on the outside. They didn't really know me. Nobody knew what I was really like on the inside, except my grandma. She wanted to know how I felt. What's the matter she asked.  And I told her everything, like how scared I was without a night-light or how awful i felt when I dropped the ball. I liked talking to grandma. She was a good listener.
